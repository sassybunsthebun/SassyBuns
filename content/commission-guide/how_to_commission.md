## This is a step-by step look at my commission process

Picture

Everything begins with the first text! Begin by letting me know you are interested in a fursuit commission and send me either a reference sheet or a detailed description of how you'd like the character to be. You also have the opportunity to send references of styles you like, components you imagine, and all that jazz!

Picture

I then show you sketches for the concept and fur colors I think would match with the character. We can make changes, and when you are satisfied with the selection, we continue to the next step. 

Picture

You then send the payment we've agreed upon, and I order the materials needed for the project. 

Picture

When all the supplies arrive, I get to work. Since I get my supplies from different sources, some supplies might arrive earlier than others.

Picture

I then send you WIP images throughout the progress. Feel free to suggest any changes and come with feedback! Once you're happy with how everything's looking, we move to the next step.

I pack your finished fursuit and get it ready for shipping.

The package then gets sent to you (in a more safe way than pictured)

And you get to enjoy your fursuit! Yay!
