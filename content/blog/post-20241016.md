title: Future commissions 
---

During 2022 I took on a lot of commissions without proper evaluation of the consequences. I have during 2023 and 2024 worked on finishing that queue, and taken action to prevent myself from taking on too much work. The fact that I took on so many commissions led to a lot of delays in the process, and commissioners ended up waiting for their commissions longer than intended. I have taken precations to avoid this, and will in the future have choosing slots and short queues with no more than one or two commssions at once. 

Because I study at university, it may still take me some time to finish commissions, but I am reducing delays as much as posssible by taking on less work at a time.
