## These are the terms and conditions which both I, the creator, and the commissioner will abide by to ensure a safe and enjoyable commission experience. By commissioning me, you agree to my Terms of Service (ToS).

These terms apply to all commissions, except if something else has been agreed upon before the commission is started.

### Who can commission me

I do not accept commissions from people under the age of 18. This includes commissions from parents or guardians on behalf of a person under the age of 18.

I prefer to only receive commissions from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland.

### Ownership and display

I retain the right to use photos of my work in my portfolio and promotional materials unless discussed and agreed upon with the client.

The client may post photos and videos of my work. Giving credit is greatly appreciated, but not strictly required.


### Payments

I use Vipps and bank transfers for payment. 
I accept payment plans, which will be discussed with each client.
I will not start your commission or order materials until the final payment has been received.
You are able to request a full refund before i buy the materials. After that you are not able to recieve a refund.

In rare circumstances, I may not be able to finish your commission. In these cases, you will receive a full refund, even if materials have been ordered.


### Deadlines

Due to the fact that fursuits take a long time to make, I cannot guarantee that I meet any deadlines such as cons, etc. I therefore do not work with deadlines. Even though I do not work with deadlines, I will still do my best to finish your work as fast as possible, and will provide updates during the making of the fursuit.

### Shipping

I ship with Posten from Norway with tracking. Do contact me about different shipping methods if Posten is not preferable for you.

### Repair

I do offer repairs and touch-ups on finished commissions. I may charge a fee for materials and/or labor depending on the complexity of the repair. This will be agreed upon before the repair is started.
The commissionner is responsible for shipping or delivering the suit to me, and for picking up or paying return shipping after the repair is finished. 
I may refuse to to repairs if the fursuit has been damaged intentionally, or as a result of improper care, such as from not following the provided [cleaning guide](../cleaning).
