## These are the terms and conditions which both I, the creator, and the commissioner will abide by to ensure a safe and enjoyable commission experience. By commissioning me, you agree to my Terms of Service (ToS).


### Who can commission me

I do not accept commissions from minors (under 18 years old) or commissions from parents or guardians on behalf of a minor.

### Conditions

My Terms of Service may be subject to change. In that case, clients will be notified ahead of time. 
It is possible to create special terms of service for projects if needed. This will be discussed with the client.

### Ownership and display

I retain the right to display my completed work in my portfolio unless discussed and agreed upon with the client. 
The client may display the commission they have received, as long as it is not in a manner that is harmful to my name and reputation. 
I also retain the right to use work-in-progress (WIP) images and share them unless discussed and agreed upon with the client. (for surprises, birthdays, etc). 

### Payments

I use Vipps and bank transfers for payment. 
I accept payment plans, which will be discussed with each client. I will not send any part of the commission unless the final/total payment has been sent.
You are able to request a refund at any time, however after materials are purchased, I cannot refund that amount immediately. I may require payment plans to do refunds as much of the income goes into buying supplies.
I have the right to refund you if I deem it is needed. I will give you full refund if I decide it is necessary and i cannot continue with the commission. 

### Process

I do not start the commission or buy supplies before the first payment has been sent.
Things may occur in my life that cause delays in my process. This is something that I sadly cannot control. Therefore, there may be unannounced delays, however, I will provide updates and communication and resume work as soon as possible.

### Deadlines

Due to the fact that fursuits take a long time to make, I cannot guarantee that I meet any deadlines such as cons, etc, so I advise commissioning at least 12 months prior for your commission to be finished in time. 
Even though I do not work with deadlines, I will still do my best to finish your work as fast as possible. 

### Shipping 

I ship with Posten from Norway with tracking. Do contact me about different shipping methods if Posten is not preferable for you.

### Repair

If there is any damage to your fursuit after you have received it, I am always open to doing repairs and touch-ups to lengthen the lifespan of the suit and keep it looking fresh. I will not do repairs on suits that have been intentionally damaged or damaged because of improper care. For how to care for your suit, visit my cleaning page.
